# RAM CALCULATOR

It calculates the percentage of difference between current RAM and desired RAM.

It is a simple C++ code that calculates desired RAM amount.

In "Enter the wanted ram amount" section, you put desired RAM size.

In "Enter the current ram amount" section, you must put your RAM size.

In "Enter the ram percentage" section, you must put your current used RAM percentage. You can see your percentage through pressing
ctrl+alt+delete at the same time.


Example:
Assume that you have 16GB RAM and your PC currently use 35% of it. What would happen if you could add another 16GB RAM and make it 32 GB system? You just upgrade your RAM 2 times more which means your percentage will be decrease as division by 2 times. So, 35% /2 = 17.5% RAM you would be have usage total.
